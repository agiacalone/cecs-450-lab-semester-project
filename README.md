# CECS 450: Semester Project

## Assignment Description

The purpose of the semester project is to implement the theory we discussed in class with designing, implementing, and evaluating visualization methods. You will be presenting a unique point of view using data to back up your conclusion. In particular, your project should address a concrete visualization problem and propose a novel, creative solution and its scope and ambition should reflect the roughly 6 weeks you have to work on it. Though the majority of final projects will typically involve developing a software artifact, design studies or evaluations of visualization techniques may also be acceptable projects â€” please talk to the instructor if you have questions.

This semester project is fairly open-ended. As long as the presention provides a uniqie, non-obvious viewpoint, which is backed by data and uses the techniques and fundamentals we have discussed during the semester, nearly any topic will be allowed (within reason for a university course, of course).

Projects will be carried out in teams of approximately three people. The final deliverable will be an implementation of the proposed solution and a short group-written paper written with the [IEEE format](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html). In addition, you will be responsible for participating in a design review and presenting your final results as part of a final project showcase at the end of the semester.

You will be keeping your project data files, R code, Python or other programming language files, and any other relevant documentation (including your write-up) in a Github git repository. I have included a Google Drive form for you to fill out (once per team, please) which will ask for your group members names, Github usernames, and the project repository. I *must* be added as a contributor to your repository, else your group will lose points.

Prior to starting your project, it is helpful to gain a sense of what goes into formulating a successful visualization project and to beware of common pitfalls. I encourage you to read the paper "A Nested Model for Visualization Design and Validation" by Tamara Munzner to get a sense of the issues surrounding bad data design (link below).
